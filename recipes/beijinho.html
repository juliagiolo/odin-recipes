    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Beijinhos are a delicious and easy to make Brazilian dessert. They are Brazilian coconut balls - essentially cocunut fudge rolled into bite-sized balls. The direct translation of the name is coconut kiss. They are great for parties!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 can of sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>Unsweetened, shredded coconut or cocunut flakes</li>
        <li>Unsalted butter</li>
        <li>Heavy cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
       <li>Combine condensed milk, butter, and heavy cream in a medium saucepan over medium heat and heat it up until the butter melts.</li>
       <li>After the butter has melted, add half of the shredded coconut to the pan and stir until combined. Keep cooking over medium heat, continuously stirring. Around 10 minutes.</li>
       <li>Pour the hot cocunut mixture into a plate, cover with platic wrap to contact, and let it it cool completely. Should take about 2 hours.</li>
       <li>Pinch off some of the dough and roll into a small ball; place on a plate. I recommend lightly buttering your hands before this step. Repeat with remaining mixture, then roll each beijinho in shredded coconut. </li>
       <li>Store the coconut fudge balls in a cool place or in the refrigerator until serving time.</li>
    </ol>
